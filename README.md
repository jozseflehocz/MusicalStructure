# MusicalStructure
The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app.
Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music.
## Screens
The app has two screens:
one for the list of the tracks: if you click on a track, it opens the Now playing screen.
The Now playing screen, which displays information the track selected by the user including the album cover.
If you click on the Tracklist button then it takes back to the Tracklist screen.
## Screenshots
