# MusicalStructure
The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app.
Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music.
## Screens
The app has two screens:
one for the list of the tracks: if you click on a track, it opens the Now playing screen.
The "now playing" screen, which displays
information the track selected by the user including the album cover.
## Screenshots
For screenshot see the project wiki screenshots page.
