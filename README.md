# MusicalStructure
The goal is to design and layout the flow for the structure of a Music Player app.
Note that for this project, the app does not actually need to play music.
The app has two screens:
one for the lsit of the tracks, the other is the "now playing" screen, which displays
information the track selected by the user including the album cover.
